title: React Algolia App

# Building Assets

This module is using webpack in the root directory of the project 
to compile the React .js files into one file for each library that
contains a single search. 

Each app interacts and displays data from a corresponding index on the algolia
servers. 

To build the js files in the ./js/[file].js use `lando npm run build`.
While developing, you can `lando npm run watch`.
